# Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)

Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.

There is only one problem...

You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? 

In fact, the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

BDD (Behavior Driven Development)

    Given: a and b
    When: The values are compared
    Then: Return an array showing their comparison

Example1

    (5, 4)   ---> "5 is greater than 4"

    (-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"

    (2, 2)   ---> "2 is equal to 2"

# PseudoCode:
Give two numbers (a) and (b) --> (5, 4)

Display which number is greater --> "5 is greater than 4"


# Code
The code is available in no_ifs_no_buts.rb
